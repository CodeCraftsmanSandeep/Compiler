# SCT - Simple Compiler Tool 
<br/>
This repositry contains compiler I built from scratch. Here after the compiler is called SCT(Simple Compiler Tool).<br/>

Synopsis <br/>
1) What language does SCT support (language specification, constructs) ??
2) What SCT does not support ??
3) What are the possible exentsions to SCT ??
4) How can you use SCT ??

The compiler is built in several phases which I built final compiler SCT.  <br/>
Have a look on phases : <br/>
	1) phase1 <br/>
	2) phase2 <br/>
	3) phase3 <br/>
	4) 
	
Each phase contains a detailed description of the constructs supported in respective readme files, test cases to evaluate, source code, include files, Makefile. The description is not repeated here to avoid redundancy which may lead to inconsistency (many times). <br/>


I am happy to receive any comments(if any) related to SCT. <br/>
