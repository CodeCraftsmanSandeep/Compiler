# Compiler
This repositry contains compiler I built from scratch. Here after the compiler is called SCT(Simple Compiler Tool).<br/>

Synopsis <br/>
1) What language does SCT support (language specification, constructs) ??
2) What SCT does not support ??
3) What are the possible exentsions to SCT ??

The compiler is built in several phases which I built final compiler SCT.  <br/>
I am happy to receive any comments(if any) related to SCT.
